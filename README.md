## Importing Data

FLIMPA currently accepts  `.sdt`,  `.ptu`, and  `.tif` file formats for phasor plot analysis. To ensure accurate results, a reference file with a known lifetime (such as a sample of Rhodamine 6G or Erythrosin B) is required to correct for instrumental errors.

For best results, we recommend using files with spatial dimensions up to 512 Ã— 512. 
Files with spatial dimensions exceeding 1000 Ã— 1000 can be analysed but may cause memory allocation errors in Python and significantly reduce analysis speed.

> *Importing `.tif` files*<br>
>
> Please ensure that your `.tif` data is in the format `(time, x, y)`. When loading your data, you will be prompted to enter the ```bin width``` (in nanoseconds), which is essential for accurate analysis.
>
> If the exact bin width is unknown, FLIMPA provides an **estimate** option, calculated as:<br>
> ```(1 / (Instrument Frequency (in Hz) * Number of Bins)) * 10^9 ```<br>
> However, this estimate may be inaccurate depending on your data acquisition settings.

**For more information on handling `.ptu` files, please refer to slides 5 and 6 of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rq5PuOyjQz3sg_ERyIjXMgyj1betNweTIrD1v64-u7o/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">online user manual</a>.**

The software can be tested using the  `.sdt` files provided in the  `sample_data` folder. These sample data were used in our publication and involve COS-7 cells stained with SiR-tubulin, treated with 40 ÂµM of Nocodazole. Control data are also included, consisting of images of untreated cells.

There are three different options for importing the data:

-	Import raw data
-	Import raw data and assign experimental conditions (e.g treated vs untreated)
-	Import raw data with manually created masks (currently masks should be created using different software for example FLIMFit)

*Example: Importing Raw Data and Assigning Experimental Conditions*

![condition_assignment_v1 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7576e13-c74f-40dd-b6f4-d93d88231342)


Please note that FLIMPA currently only accepts single files and does not support the analysis of time-lapse data.

## Running Phasor Plot Analysis

To run the phasor plot analysis, the following parameters need to be specified:

- `Laser Frequency` (in MHz)
- Upload a `Reference File`
- `Reference File Lifetime` (in ns)
- `Number of Time Bins` (*default*: 3x3)
- `Minimum Photon Count Threshold` (*optional*, at least 100 p.c. per pixel recommended)
- `Maximum Photon Count Threshold` (*optional*)
- `Baseline correction` (selecting `True` will remove constant DC noise from the fluorescence decay curve, improving Fourier Transform analysis)
- `% time bins (baseline corr.)` (*default*: 3.5%, percentage of the initial time bins used for baseline correction)

Warning: If the true fluorescent signal is present in the initial time bins (due to issues like excessive .ptu file time binning or microscope settings), performing `Baseline correction` correction will subtract signal along with the noise, leading to inaccurate results. To ensure proper use of `Baseline correction` and `% time bins (baseline corr.)` please refer to slide 11 of our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rq5PuOyjQz3sg_ERyIjXMgyj1betNweTIrD1v64-u7o/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">online user manual</a>.

## Phasor Plot Visualisation 
FLIMPA enables to visualisation of phasor plots from single images and combined plots from multiple samples.  Additionally three different phasor visualisation options: `scatter` plots, `histograms` and `contour` maps.

## Saving Data

FLIMPA also allows users to export all generated data. This includes:

- **Lifetime and Intensity Maps:** Exported as `.png` and raw `.tif` files.
- **Gallery Visualisations:** Lifetime and intensity galleries exported as `.png` files.
- **Phasor Plots and Violin Plots:** Saved with a transparent background.
- **Statistical Data:** A `.csv` file containing the mean fluorescence lifetime per image can be exported for further statistical analysis.
